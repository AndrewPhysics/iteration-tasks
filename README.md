# iteration-tasks
Complete 12 different iteration excesises with menu structure as a command line application.

1. Find the factorial of any integer number.

2. Determine the modulus of division (natural number with a natural number). During division when the residue is generated 
the operations of multiplication and division are not allowed!

3. Determine the result of multiplication without using multip. operator.

4. Determine the result of multiplication without using multip. operator. You can only use multiplication by 2 and division by 2 operations.

5. Determine the power of a real number with positive integer exponent, you are not allowed to use the built in power function in C++.

6. Use Euklides algorithm to determine greatest common divisor of two integer numbers.

7. Find least common multiple of any given integer variable.

8. Find the sum of positive odd numbers which are not greater than n.

9. Fill up the display's first line with an arbitrary character.

10. Prepare program, which sets up an arithmetic series (the first element and size of the series is defined by user).

11. Prepare program, which stes up an geometric series (the first element and quotient of the series is given by user).

12. Prepare program, which can find an integer from 1 to 100!  The users can tip until the program can find the number.
